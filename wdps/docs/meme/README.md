# Position specific scoring matrices for TFs v5.0

### Description of the dataset

The PSSMs version 5.0 are built using the annotated binding sites of TFs from RegulonDB version 12.0. A matrix is built for all TFs with four or more annotated sites. 

### Data Summary

Two subsets are generated: 

1. **Matrices for Confirmed & Strong TFBS**.

   - Total number of matrices including binding sites with `strong` or `confirmed` evidence: `97`

2. **Matrices for All TFBS**.

   - Total number of matrices including all binding sites: `109`


### Method

#### Programs

 * [MEME version 5.4.0](https://meme-suite.org/meme/doc/install.html?man_type=web)

#### Datasets, databases, files

1. *Genome Sequence*

  - Genome Sequence Identifier U00096.3.  
  - E. coliâ€™s Genome Version: version 3 (U00096.3).  

2. *RegulonDB dataset*  
  2.1 [Transcription Factor Regulatory Interactions - TF-RISet.tsv file](https://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/datasets/TFSet) version 12.0

3. *Protocol*

  1. TFBSs were retrieved from RegulonDB web page TF-RISet.tsv. Two types of matrices were generated: a) matrices including only binding sites with `Strong` or `Confirmed` evidence, and b) matrices including all annotated binding sites.
  2. Only unique genomic sites were retained, and TFs with four or more sites were analyzed. In the case of CRP, binding sites with unusual sizes were excluded (it means that small sites or those outside the average were excluded).
  3. The binding site sequences were retrieved, including 3 base pairs on each side of the binding site. 
  4. The MEME version 5.4.0 was executed to generate matrices of different sizes (median length of the binding site +/- 3 base pairs). MEME was run in "One Occurrence Per Sequence" mode, excluding the search in the reverse complement, specifying "dna" as the alphabet, and utilizing the U00096.3 Markov background model file for normalization.

### Results

Total number of matrices including binding sites with `strong` or `confirmed` evidence: `97`

Each TF has a directory with the MEME results: 


- `index.html`: HTML file with the results, it integrates the logo and meme results. 
- Logo files
   - `logo1.png`	
   - `logo1.eps`	
   - `logo_rc1.png`
   - `logo_rc1.eps`	
- `meme.xml` : resuls in XML format
- `meme.txt`: results in text format	
- `ri_sites.fasta`: the input, non redundant TF binding sites in fasta format
